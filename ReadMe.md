# Fine-Tuning Llama2 with LoRA
## Author: Neelesh Batham
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama2 Large Language Model (LLM) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to achieve improved performance on specific tasks while maintaining the model's general capabilities. LoRA allows for efficient parameter updates by focusing on adapting the weights of a pretrained model through low-rank matrices, making it ideal for tasks that require model specialization without extensive retraining.
